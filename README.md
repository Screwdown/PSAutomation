Automating tasks with Powershell

I am making my own script language for doing crude automation
based on mouse clicks and send-keys type technology.
The script language is called My Script Language ie MSL.
MSL scripts can also call other MSL scripts (or themselves).
There are no script variables just command parameters.
So it is very, very basic but still suitable to doing trivial 
tasks in gaming or pc housekeeping.

@ 2017 Nov 14 I am using Powershell 5.1
